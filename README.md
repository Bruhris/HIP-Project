# HIP Project

The project I worked on during my internship at the University of Alberta. It is a C++ themed version of the game Semantle, utilizing word vectors and implemented in Python using flask. The word vector model is trained using the text in the corpora folder where it is
then processed and normalized. The textProcessor folder contains the word embedding algorithm that will be used to create word embeddings using the respective text and the text_normailzer folder contains the files necessary for preprocessing the corpora for proper use.
